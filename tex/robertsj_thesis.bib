  abstract = {Recent work has revisited the eigenvalue response matrix method as
        an approach for reactor core analyses. In its most straightforward
        form, the method consists of a two-level eigenproblem. An outer Picard
        iteration updates the k-eigenvalue, while the inner eigenproblem
        imposes current continuity between coarse meshes. In this paper,
        several eigensolvers are evaluated for this inner problem, using
        several 2-D diffusion benchmarks as test cases. The results indicate
        both the explicitly-restarted Arnoldi and the Krylov-Schur methods
        are up to an order of magnitude more efficient than power iteration.
        This increased efficiency makes the nested eigenvalue formulation
        more effective than the ILU-preconditioned Newton-Krylov formulation
        previously studied.},

        (JFNK) method is employed to solve the sys- tem, using an approximate
        Jacobian coupled with incomplete factorization as a preconditioner.
        The unpreconditioned JFNK slightly outperforms PI, and preconditioned
        JFNK outperforms both PI and Steffensen-accelerated PI significantly.},

  abstract = {A new core analysis method has been developed in which neutronic calculations
        using a three-dimensional direct response matrix (3D-DRM) method
        are coupled with thermal-hydraulic calculations. As it requires neither
        a diffusion approximation nor a homogenization process of lattice
        constants, a precise representation of the neutronic heterogeneity
        effect in an advanced core design is possible. Moreover, the pin-by-pin
        power distribution can be directly evaluated, which enables precise
        evaluations of core thermal margins. Verification of the neutronic
        calculation using the 3D-DRM method was examined by analyses of cold
        criticality experiments of commercial power plants. The standard
        deviations and maximum differences in predicted neutron multiplication
        factors were 0.07\%$\Delta k$ and 0.19\%$\Delta k$ for a BWR5 plant,
        and 0.11\%$\Delta k$ and 0.25\%$\Delta k$ for an ABWR plant, respectively.
        A coupled analysis of the 3D-DRM method and thermal-hydraulic calculations
        for a quarter ABWR core was done, and it was found that the thermal
        power and coolant-flow distributions were smoothly converged.},

  abstract = {Jacobian-free Newton�Krylov (JFNK) methods are synergistic combinations
        of Newton-type methods for superlinearly convergent solution of nonlinear
        equations and Krylov subspace methods for solving the Newton correction
        equations. The link between the two methods is the Jacobian-vector
        product, which may be probed approximately without forming and storing
        the elements of the true Jacobian, through a variety of means. Various
        approximations to the Jacobian matrix may still be required for preconditioning
        the resulting Krylov iteration. As with Krylov methods for linear
        problems, successful application of the JFNK method to any given
        problem is dependent on adequate preconditioning. JFNK has potential
        for application throughout problems governed by nonlinear partial
        differential equations and integro-differential equations. In this
        survey paper, we place JFNK in context with other nonlinear solution
        algorithms for both boundary value problems (BVPs) and initial value
        problems (IVPs). We provide an overview of the mechanics of JFNK
        and attempt to illustrate the wide variety of preconditioning options
        available. It is emphasized that JFNK can be wrapped (as an accelerator)
        around another nonlinear fixed point method (interpreted as a preconditioning
        process, potentially with significant code reuse). The aim of this
        paper is not to trace fully the evolution of JFNK, nor to provide
        proofs of accuracy or optimal convergence for all of the constituent
        methods, but rather to present the reader with a perspective on how
        JFNK may be applicable to applications of interest and to provide
        sources of further practical information.},
